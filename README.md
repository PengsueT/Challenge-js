# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description
This week's Challenge is JavaScript code that I wrote with starter code given to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. I added Javascript to the script.js file, that way when I click the button I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary. I am able to add more employees to the array and when I choose not to add employees, the data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name. My motivation behind this project is to put my JavaScript into use and challenge myself to apply the skills needed to achieve the acceptance criteria.
